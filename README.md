# Military Strength Clustering and Visualization

This project uses **KMeans clustering** to categorize countries based on various **military** and **geographical factors**, followed by a visualization of these clusters on a world map.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset containing **military strength** and various **geographical statistics** of countries around the world. The dataset is clustered into four categories using the KMeans algorithm, and the results are visualized by color-coding the countries on a world map based on their respective cluster.

## Methodology

### KMeans Clustering

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   * Handle missing values (if any).
   * Standardize numerical features for better clustering performance.

2. **KMeans Algorithm**:
   * The dataset is clustered using KMeans clustering with `n_clusters=4`.
   * The optimal number of clusters is determined by the silhouette score, which is 0.86 in this case, indicating good separation between the clusters.

3. **Cluster Analysis**:
   * The countries are grouped into four clusters based on their military strength and other features.

## Visualization
A world map is generated where each country is colored based on the cluster it belongs to. The countries' geographical locations and clusters are visually represented, making it easy to observe regional and global patterns in military strength.

## Results
* **Silhouette Score**: 0.86, indicating that the clustering is well-defined.
* **Number of Clusters**: 4.
* The countries are assigned to clusters, which are visualized on a world map.
